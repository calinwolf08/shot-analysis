# Algorithm Learnings

This document tracks insights, patterns, and learnings discovered during iterative testing of the shot detection algorithm.

## Purpose

As we test the algorithm against labeled video data, we document:
- What works well and why
- What doesn't work and potential causes
- Patterns in false positives/negatives
- Ideas for algorithm improvements

## Orientation Detection

### Current Approach
The orientation detection uses shoulder and hip X positions plus Z-depth to classify camera angle into 8 orientations:
- front, front-left, front-right
- side-left, side-right
- behind, behind-left, behind-right

### Observations

_Add observations as testing progresses_

---

## Shot Boundary Detection

### Start Frame Detection

_Document patterns observed in shot start detection_

---

### End Frame Detection

_Document patterns observed in shot end detection_

---

## False Positives

Cases where the algorithm detected a shot that wasn't there:

| Video | Frame Range | Likely Cause | Notes |
|-------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| | | | |

---

## False Negatives

Cases where the algorithm missed a labeled shot:

| Video | Expected Frames | Likely Cause | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| | | | |

---

## Frame Timing Issues

Cases where shots were detected but with frame boundaries outside tolerance:

| Video | Shot # | Start Diff | End Diff | Likely Cause | Notes |
|-------|--------|------------|----------|--------------|-------|
| | | | | | |
